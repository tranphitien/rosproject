#this file is used to configure common parameters. The parameters are used in local_costmap and global_costmap

#obstacle_range and raytrace_range attributes attribute are used to indicate the maximun distance that the sensor will read 
#and introduce new information in the costmaps.
#the first on is used for the obstacles, if the robot detects an obstacle closer than 2.5m in our case, it will put the obstacle
#in the costmap
#the other one is used to clean/clear the costmap and update the free space in it when the robot moves.

#map_type: voxel

#the footprint attribute is used to indicate to the navigation stack the geometry of the robot. It will be used to keep the right
#distance between obstacle and the robot or to know if the robot can go through a door

#footprint: [[-0.2, -0.2], [-0.2, 0.2], [0.2, 0.2], [0.2, -0.2]]

#the inflation_radius attribute is the value given to keep a minimal distance between the geometry of the robot and the obstacle
inflation_radius: 0.35

cost_scaling_factor: 10

#this attribute can set the sensors used by the navigation stack to get the data from the real world and calculate the path

#the laser configured in the previous line is used to add and clear obstacles in the costmap
#the topic's name is configured in this line, it is important to configure it well because the navigation stack could wait 
#for another topic, all this while the robot is moving and it can crash into a wall or an obstacle
