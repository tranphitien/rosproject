#obstacle_range and raytrace_range attributes are used to indicate the maximun distance that the sensor will read and introduce new information in the costmaps.
#the first one is used for the obstacles, if the robot detects an obstacle closer than 3m in our case, it will put the obstacle in the costmap
#the other one is used to clean/clear the costmap and update the free space in it when the robot moves.

#the laser configured in the previous line is used to add and clear obstacles in the costmap
#the topic's name is configured in this line, it is important to configure it well because the navigation stack could wait 
#for another topic, all this while the robot is moving and it can crash into a wall or an obstacle
